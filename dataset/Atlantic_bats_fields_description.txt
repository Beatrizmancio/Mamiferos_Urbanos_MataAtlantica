Descrição

- ID = Identification code for each record.
- Authors = Short name of author without special characters 
- Type = Type of publication. Thesis refer to monographs, theses and dissertations.
- Reference = Reference in Ecology style
- Voucher_Specimens = Name of the collection where voucher specimens were deposited. It is possible to find more than one reference per study ID. 
- Year_start = Year of the beginning of the study 
- Year_finish = Year of the end of study. Many were vague. 
- Duration = Unstandardized duration of study. Several were vague.
- Season = Season reported in the reference paper 
- Method = Capture method used for capturing bats 
- Strata_sampling = Vertical strata location where capturing was performed
- Nights = Total number of capture nights 
- hours_per_night = Duration of capture, i.e. number of hours mistnets were open. We reported the maximum as 12 hours also for the studies conducted during the dry season. 
- number_of_mistnets = Number of mistnets used, regardless of their length, mesh, or material. 
- effort_straube_bianconi = Effort accounting area of the mistnets and duration of the survey given in hours*square meters (Straube and Bianconi 2002). Since many studies do not report mistnet size or model, this standardized measure is common for comparing bat inventories.
- Sampling_habitat = Brief description of the area where the mist net stations were placed. Information was obtained from the reference paper or from the author of unpublished data.
- Community = Reported bat assemblage. All: when all bat assemblage was reported. Leafnosed: phyllostomid species data (leaf-nosed bats) were reported. 
- Class = Taxonomic class
- Order = Taxonomic order
- Superfamily = Taxonomic superfamily
- Family = Taxonomic family
- Capture_number = Number of captures 
- Species = Species name
- Status = Status in global assessment of IUCN Red List
- Country = English name of the country
- State = State, Province or Department of the study site derived based on the geographic coordinates
- Municipality = Municipality of the study site derived based on the geographic coordinates 
- Study_location = Local name of the study site derived based on the information in the reference paper.
- Latitude Corrected and transformed coordinates of the latitude in decimal degrees (Datum WGS84). 
- Longitude = Corrected and transformed coordinates of the longitude. 
- Precision = Coordinate precision of the study site.
- Reserve_Area = Reserve area reported in the reference paper, value in hectars (ha)
- Altitude = Meters above sea level reported in the reference paper or obtained later based on the corrected coordinates
- Altitude1km = Altitude in meters above sea level, from the Hydro-1K dataset 
- Annual_mean_temperature = Annual mean temperature. 
- Annual_rainfall = Annual rainfall. 
- Olsong200r = Olson bioregion (Olson et al. 2001), represented by G200_REGIO column of the shapefile wwf_terr_ecos
- Olsoneconame = ECO_NAME column of the shapefile wwf_terr_ecos available in WWF website (Olson et al. 2001).
- ribeirovegtype = Type of vegetation sensu Ribeiro et al. (2009)
- BSRs = Type of biogeographical sub-regions (BSRs) sensu Ribeiro et al. (2009)
- uc = Level of protection of the study site area. Yes: protected areas, including Botanical Parks, National, State Parks. No: study site is not located in a protected area. 
- protectedtype = Type of the protected area column DESIG of shapefile available in WDPA IUCN and UNEP-WCMC (year), The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) [Online], [insert month/year of the version downloaded], Cambridge, UK: UNEPWCMC.
